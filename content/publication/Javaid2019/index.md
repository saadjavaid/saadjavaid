# Abstract.
abstract = "Cracks grow in millimeter-scale, ductile metal sheets when a transverse neck fracture process zone fails by microvoid coalescence. Here we showed that the crack growth mechanism changed to a different steady-state process when sheet thicknesses were  100 Î¼m. We experimentally quantified the shape, extent, and evolution of the process zones in 1235 Al and showed that three zones were operating: A large, uncontained plastic zone (PZ) ahead of the crack tip had an embedded, steady-state zone of active plasticity (ZAP) that surrounded a transverse neck fracture process zone (FPZ) which failed via a microvoid-free shear mechanism."
