I am a PhD candidate in [Materials Science and Engineering](http://www.mse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I recently completed my MBA from [Scheller College of Business](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/index.html) with a focus on [Technology Commercialization (TI:GER)](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/centers-initiatives/tiger/index.html) and [Technology Management & Innovation](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/degree-programs/mba/full-time-program/curriculum/concentrations/managing-innovation-technology.html). I am also a [Sam Num Security Fellow](https://cistp.gatech.edu/programs/sam-nunn-security-program) at the Center for International Strategy, Technology, and Policy at Georgia Tech. My doctoral research focuses on evaluating damage, fracture and failure mechanisms in materials using experimental techniques employing computer vision and tracking.
