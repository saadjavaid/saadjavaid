# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "Fatigue crack growth in thin metallic sheets is usually associated with periodic arrest because of a microtructurally-sensitive crack growth mechanism. In this paper we will show how fatigue cracks grow in 25 micrometer thick aluminum sheets under various crack tip conditions. Full field strain maps of the crack tips will be used to establish the different conditions for crack."
