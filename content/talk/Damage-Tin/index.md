# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "Creep-Fatigue interactions are observed in certain materials at high temperature and intermediate hold times / strain rates. In this study, we present and experimental study of the damage evolution due to creep-fatigue loading in thin Sn sheets. This ductile, non-cubic model system is a platform to study how twinning, dislocation motion, and diffusion contribute to damage accumulation processes in non-cubic, ductile metals. The crack propagation rates and process zones were characterized at various fatigue loading and temperature conditions through strain mapping with Digital Image Correlation (DIC)."
