summary = "Damage evolution in thin tin sheets are challenging due to multiple deformation mechanisms and behavior at play. We have the ability to melt, cast, roll, heat treat and test the material. Coupled with its tetragonal structure, multiple active deformation mechanisms such as slip and twinning and tendency to creep at room temperature make it an interesting model system to explore."

We explore the damage evolution in thin ductile sheets through various loading conditions. By evaluating how the damage evolves , we aim to predict and control the deformation in such systems. In the absence of conventional fracture mechanics $K$ or $J$ approaches for such highly ductile systems, we are trying to find other ways of predicting crack growth.
