We study crack growth and fracture mechanisms by using full field, high resolution Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Our in house setup allows us to probe damage evolution through full field strains. The flexibility to morph the algorithms according to our needs and areas of interests open new doors in studying conventional materials to garner new insights. 

Manuscripts highlighting the strengths of the framework are in preparation.
