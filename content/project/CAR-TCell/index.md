This project was a part of the my TI:GER Program project in which we collaborate with a team of PhD, JD and MBA students to commercialize a technology. Our product was a novel biomedical activation switch with applications in CAR-T Cell Solid State Cancer and Diabetes. We worked on the project for 3 semesters and carried out market analysis, physician interviews, business model development and elevator pitches. The project was deemed viable in collaboration from pharmaceutical companies and the PI is building a patent portfolio while establishing commercial collaboration linkages to take the design forward.
