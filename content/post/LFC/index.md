I have been an avid Liverpool Football Club (LFC) follower for years now. This is after the club had been knocked off their perch by Manchester United, and before they had won the [Miracle of Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_UEFA_Champions_League_Final) so I have the luxury of saying that I have supported this club when they were not at their prime and had not pulled off the Cinderella story either.

Its a welcome distraction as it gives me something to look forward to on weekends mostly, and allows me to have something other than my PhD and family to think about. The problem is, more often than not, this is a club that gives you hope and frustrates you - much like a PhD. You get a few good results and you are over the moon, and then it all comes crashing down - to be build up again. I guess the fact that I chose to follow this club means I am an optimist and I like challenges because it has been 29 years since they won the league. The good news is that they look good this year, much like my PhD progress :smiley:.

Football (Soccer) doesn't have a crazy following in the US, yet I have been able to find a bunch of fellow grad students who are LFC supporters and we all agree that this is truly a universal sport that connects the entire globe like none other.

This is what the club is all about - I believe this is one of the best marketing videos ever made for a football club. Enjoy #YNWA
