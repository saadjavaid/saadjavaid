After years of waiting, we finally have a trophy - and its the biggest of them all. I mentioned being an avid LFC supporter since long and I supported them mostly through the lows. Modern football is all about the "money" model - dump money in, buy the best players and coaches and try to succeed overnight (case in point Chelsea, Man City et al). People believed that the "moneyball" model could never succeed in a sport like soccer (football). [Liverpool tried this approach](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/magazine/soccer-data-liverpool.html) and I guess a mixture of smart [recruiting based off of analytics](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/magazine/soccer-data-liverpool.html) and spending money on shoring up the defense worked for LFC. We have the coveted "big ears" again for the sixth time and after losing his last 5 finals, Jurgen Klopp perhaps deserved it the most. He talked about how the process is more important for him than winning overnight and I agree with him. For some reason it felt so surreal and ever more sweet because of how much we wanted it and how we got there.

There were so many individual stories in this journey which makes it so rewarding. 

1.  The first would be ofcourse none other than Jurgen Klopp. The guy wears his heart on his sleeve and has seen so many heartbreaks. He approaches it in a very unconventional way too - which is why we love him even more.

2.  What about Jordan Henderson then? The club captain that some thought had a weird "gait" or whom even some fans just completely trash. The guy taking over from Stevie G, a club legend and actually bringing home the next major success is such a proud moment. The guy gives it his all and truly deserves lifting the trophy. 

3.  [Andy Robertson - The guy who started from the rock bottom](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/andy-robertson-liverpool-champions-league) and is now arguably the best left back in the world. His story, hard work and humility are truly inspiring.  

4.  Trent Alexander Arnold, a local lad who is living his dream and has been in 2 UCL finals - and he is 20. Let that sink in. 

5.  Salah who was considered a Chelsea reject, a flop, coming to LFC and winning the golden boot twice in two seasons, a plethora of awards and Times 100 most influential personalities, all while [contributing a reduction in Islamophobia](https://immigrationlab.org/working-paper-series/can-exposure-celebrities-reduce-prejudice-effect-mohamed-salah-islamophobic-behaviors-attitudes-2/)

6.  Origi who was on the fringes and not rated at all - coming in to score crucial goals. 

7.  I am not even going to try to mention people like VVD, Allison improving the team, Matip raising his game immensely, Fabinho being rock solid, Mane being the joint top scorer in the league and contributing immense goals in the UCL. The whole aura of the team was marvelous and whats amazing is that all these players are young and in their prime with a manager that truly loves them. LFC is going to be some force in the coming years and us patient, loyal supporters will revel in it !
