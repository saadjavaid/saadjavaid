I am an avid Rudyard Kiping fan and his poem "If" is one of my go to pieces of literature for inspiration. I have spent a considerable amount of time learning, pursuing and even teaching materials so its only befitting that today I found something that combines both. Kipling's not-so-subtle take on which material is superior - enjoy.

>'Gold is for the mistress - silver for the maid -
Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade.'
"Good !' said the Baron, sitting in his hall, 
'But Iron - Cold Iron - is master of them all.'

_Rudyard Kipling_ _"Cold Iron"_
